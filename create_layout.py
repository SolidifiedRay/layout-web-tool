<Purpose>
  Creates a basic in-toto layout by reading an ordered list of step link files.

  ** Infer layout fields: **
    expires:
            default value
    keys:
            FIXME: Keys are currently ignored in this module
    steps:
            add steps in the order of passed link files
            name:
                    link.name
            expected_command:
                    link.command
            threshold:
                    default value
            expected_materials/expected_products:
                    currently uses simple approach (see below)
                    FIXME: Should use more complex approach (see ideas below)
            inspections:
                    FIXME Inspections are currently ignored in this module
            signatures:
                    empty (use `in-toto-sign` command line utility)


  ** Infer step artifact rules (simple approach) **
    ** expected_materials **

      IF no materials were recorded
        expected_materials: [["DISALLOW", "*"]]

      ELSE IF materials were recorded and it is the first step
        expected_materials: [["ALLOW", "*"]]

      ELSE
        expected_materials: [["MATCH", "*", "WITH", "PRODUCTS", "FROM", <PREVIOUS STEP>]


    ** expected_products **

      IF no products were recorded
        expected_products: [["DISALLOW", "*"]]

      ELSE products were recorded:
        expected_products: [["ALLOW", "*"]]


  ** Ideas for more complexity: **
    - explicitly, ALLOW or MATCH files by name instead of "*", e.g.:
      expected_materials = \
          [["ALLOW", material] for material in links[index].materials.keys()]

    - for MATCH rules
      match only those that already were in the previous step
      allow the rest by name


  <Usage>

    ```
    # Create a layout given an ordered list of link file paths

    links = []
    for LINK_PATH in LINK_PATHS:
      link = in_toto.models.link.Link.read_from_file(LINK_PATH)
      links.append(link)

    layout = create_layout_from_ordered_links(links)
    layout.dump()
